# CS300Final
Final Submission for CS300

    What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
    - In this course we were trying to optimize run time for different list structures as it pertains to adding, subtracting, and sorting items.
    How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
    - Data structures are critical to writing efficient code. Without good algorithms code can take a long time to execute and can become difficult to read and understand.
    How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
    - Roadblocks were overcome using online resources such as stack overflow as well as the zybooks learning modules.
    How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
    - This project has forced me to consider run times when designing code.
    How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    - This has further re-enforced that the planning phase of writing code is the most important part.
